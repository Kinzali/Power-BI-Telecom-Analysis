# Power-BI-Telecom-Analysis
Telecom Network analysis using Power BI.

## Problem Statement:
In the realm of telecom performance, the challenge lies in optimizing network efficiency and user experience. This project addresses concerns related to the average user throughput of the network and user download (DL) time, where certain sectors exhibit suboptimal performance, resulting in degraded user satisfaction. Identifying and rectifying these issues is crucial for enhancing overall network performance.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this Power BI analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of telecom performance metrics, focusing on average user throughput and user DL time per user. By discerning the best-performing sectors with the highest user throughput and lower DL times, as well as identifying the underperforming sectors with lower user throughput and higher DL times, the goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights. This project aims to guide strategic decision-making for network optimization, ultimately improving the quality of service and user satisfaction.
